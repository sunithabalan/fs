<center> <p>  The Indian agriculture and it's economy are strongly influenced by the vagaries of the weather.<br>
                 The farming community is in great need to have access to weather information to plan and <br>
			   manage their crops and their livelihoods. One of the important communication system which is <br>
			     gaining increased  acceptance in the recent times is the Internet.Weather warnings are <br>
			   important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property. Forecasts based on <br>
			     temperature and precipitation are important to agriculture, and therefore to traders <br>
			   within commodity markets. Temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate <br>
			     demand over coming days. On an everyday basis, people use weather forecasts to <br>
			  determine what to wear on a given day.Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy <br>
			  rain, snow and wind chill, forecasts can be used to plan activities ahead and survive them.</p></center>

<center><h3>Needs For Weather Forewarning</h3>
<p><width="50"> The need for weather information as an adaptation strategy for climate variability and change has been emphasized by farmers, <br>
      and institutions working in the study areas. However, difficulty in understanding the weather forecast terminology and <br>
	details, lack of representativeness of the forecast, inconsistency in the time of information provision and language problems<br>
	  are mentioned as major barriers in accessing and using weather information for climate change adaptation. <br> </p></center>
