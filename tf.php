<center><h3>TIPS FOR FARMERS</h3>
<p> <font face="arial" font size="4" >
There are many ways to improve sustainability on your farm – whether it’s agroforestry (planting trees that give nutrients back to the soil), <br>
   intercropping (planting different types of crops from year to year to ensure the soil can recover from different harvests), or using <br>
 organic fertilizers – many are low-cost, simple and they can help to prevent environmental degradation, deforestation and food insecurity.<br>
Africa has many wonderful projects that encourage sustainability (Green Belt Movement and initiatives by CPF are some good examples to look at <br>
 if you have the time) – however, we wanted to show you that farmers are also promoting sustainable agriculture to other farmers, through <br>
    WeFarm.We only have one earth so we should do all that we can in our power to protect it. Harnessing peer-to-peer information is one <br>
	                                     way to promote sustainability, from the bottom-up.<br>

Here are some of the latest tips on sustainable agriculture from our farmers in Kenya:

1  Sprinkle wood ash as an organic fertilizer if your soil is too acidic. 
2  Use rabbit droppings as an organic fertilizer for tomato plants as it will increase crop yield. 
3  Use plant leftover bits as a mulch to to eliminate weeds and promote micro-organism functions.
4  Organic soils; six golden rules 
    1 – feed the soil 
	2 – Tread carefully 
	3 – dig only when needed 
	4 – keep soil surface covered 
	5 – do not over fertilize 
	6 – check pH before liming. 
	NB; soil is the starting point for organic farmers, life begins in the soil. 
	So it’s important to know more about our soils and how to care for them. 
5  Rabbit’s urine is a biological fertilizer.
6  If u practice skip planting i.e this year you do corn, the next year you do potatoes your yield will 
   get better and better every time you do a 2nd time your previous crop. 
7  Use animal waste as a manure for coffee to improve yield. 
8  Use ash in your farm after the first ploughing to boost the soil PH and on crops as an organic pesticide. 
9  Leucoena leucosefala is a good tree used in agroforestry. It has all the qualities i.e deep roots to reduce 
   competition for nutrients and also unspreading branches wow now you know! 
10 Grafting improves fruit trees productivity and helps to grows large fruit. Farmers can earn more from their 
   fruit trees, prevent diseases, and even reduce the growing period through grafting. 
11 Plant trees like ‘grevellea’ on the sides of your shamba so as to act as windbreaks,provide shade and increase 
   soil fertility from the leaves that drop.
12 Farmers should always practice crop rotation and intercropping in order to utilise their lands properly. 
13 It is recommended to plant tall trees around maize field to act as windbreaker hence protecting maize plants from being uprooted. 
14 You can practice crop rotation of tomatoes with cabbages, or potatoes.</pre>
